Payroll Date – Input Form will be locked down based on next available payroll date….shouldn’t be able to go back to past weeks.
Have a filter to filter on all weekly/hourly employees only  (data from UltiPro)
Rename location to Region in the table (e.g.  Great Lake is region not location name)
Attachments should be associated to form header instead at induvial employee level
Incentive $ should have a check … only valid between $0.01 to $5,000.00
Incentive $ format should be number with 2 decimal places
Leo will check w/ Branch Manager on the approval process and will let us know. 
The suggestion is to have Primary Approver and Secondary Approver.  After preparer submitted the form, an email should go to primary approver.  If after a couple of hours form is not yet approved, forward form to secondary approver to approve.
Payroll need to be superuser who can overwrite $ amounts or submit form on behalf of branch managers
